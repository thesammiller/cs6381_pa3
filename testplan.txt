test plan: 

1) test pubs/subs evenly distributed among 2 brokers once the threshold is reached
2) test pubs/subs evently distributed among 3 brokers once the threshold is reached
3) test pubs/subs realign by going over the threshold and then going back down 


for pub/sub: 
# pub with highest ownership but lower history 
publisher.py 12345 BROKER 5 # should have higher ownership because created first
publisher.py 12345 BROKER 10 # less ownership


# subs requiring diff history
subscriber.py 12345 BROKER 4
subscriber.py 12345 BROKER 7 #also check that pub chops the extra history off so sub only receives the asked for amount 

#kill the pub with the highest ownership to check that the first sub is reassigned
